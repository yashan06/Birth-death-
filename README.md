# Birth and Death
Yashan oswal -KU2407U448

## Overview
This project provides a Python-based simulation and analysis of birth and death processes. These stochastic processes are fundamental in understanding various phenomena in fields such as biology, epidemiology, and population dynamics. The program implements basic models, visualizations, and simulations to study the behavior of such systems over time.

## Features
- Simulate birth-and-death processes using customizable parameters.
- Analyze equilibrium states and time-dependent behaviors.
- Visualize the process using plots for better understanding.
- Modular and well-documented code for easy extension.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed:
- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Python Libraries
The following libraries are required:
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing data.
- `scipy` (optional): For advanced statistical and mathematical analysis.

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/birth-and-death.git
cd birth-and-death
```

## Usage
1. **Run the Simulation**
   Execute the main Python script to simulate a birth-and-death process:
   ```bash
   python simulation.py
   ```
   
2. **Customize Parameters**
   Edit the parameters such as birth rate, death rate, and initial population in the `config.json` file or directly in the script.

3. **View Results**
   The output will include:
   - Population trends over time.
   - Equilibrium distributions.
   - Visual plots saved in the `output/` directory.

# Birth and Death Rate Trends Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the trends in birth and death rates over time using historical data. The analysis is performed using Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization. The goal is to provide insights into demographic changes and public health trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is `birth_death_rates.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- **Year**: The year of the recorded data.
- **Birth Rate**: The number of births per 1,000 people.
- **Death Rate**: The number of deaths per 1,000 people.

### Instructions for Use
1. **Replace Placeholder Text**: Make sure to replace `https://github.com/yourusername/birth-death-rate-trends.git` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
2. **Output Image**: If you have an output image of the chart, replace `output_chart.png` with the actual path to that image.
3. **Add License**: If you have a specific license for your project, include it in the `LICENSE` file and mention it in the README.
